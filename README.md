# Employee Attrition Analysis Using Tableau
***Background of Problem:***

XYZ Corporation is a globally well-known mid to large-sized technology company. 

Founded over half a decade ago by a visionary entrepreneur (back in 2018), it has since grown into a formidable force in the industry, boasting a diverse portfolio of products and services that require a significant IT infrastructure, including networking, databases, and software development that cater to the needs of their global clientele.

The company has sought external professional services from ABC Consulting Firm regarding employee turnover problems that they are currently facing. As one of the consulting team members specialising in HR, I am tasked to perform employee attrition and other HR-related analyses on XYZ Corporation.

***Objectives:***

1. To produce overall HR analytics dashboards before drilling into several aspects for further analysis - **Demographics, Organizational Structure, and Training & Performance**.

2. To provide recommendations on the persistent issue of employee attrition based on the findings.
